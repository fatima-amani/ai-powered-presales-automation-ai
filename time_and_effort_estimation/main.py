def estimate_effort(feature_breakdown):
    """Estimate development, testing, and DevOps efforts using Mistral LLM."""
    
    prompt = f"""
        Based on the given software features and subfeatures, estimate effort (in days) for each role:
        
        - **Development**
        - **Testing**
        - **DevOps**
        
        The estimation should be **granular**, providing effort at the **subfeature level** while maintaining the module and feature hierarchy.

        Ensure the output strictly follows this JSON format:

        {{
            "effort_estimation": [
                {{
                    "module": "Module Name",
                    "features": [
                        {{
                            "name": "Feature Name",
                            "subfeatures": [
                                {{
                                    "name": "Subfeature Name",
                                    "development_days": X,
                                    "testing_days": Y,
                                    "devops_days": Z
                                }}
                            ]
                        }}
                    ],
                    "development_days": X,
                    "testing_days": Y,
                    "devops_days": Z,
                }}
            ]
        }}

        **Guidelines:**
        - Assign **realistic effort estimates** based on standard development practices.
        - Complex subfeatures (e.g., authentication, API integrations) should have **higher effort estimates**.
        - Simple subfeatures (e.g., UI changes, minor configurations) should have **lower effort estimates**.
        - Ensure all values are in whole or decimal numbers representing effort in **days**.
